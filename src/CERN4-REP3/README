azimuthal_assembly.py

   Reads file prefix and path from workflow containing a series of diffraction
images to be assembled.  For each file in the directory matching the file
prefix the underscore delimited parameters are extracted, image integrated and
put into a numpy array w.r.t. the parameters.  The numpy array is exported to a
H5 file in the DAWN workflow.

calibrate.py

   Loads calibration file, does some simple thresholding to reduce nois and
performs calibration of the Perkin detector.

dark_currrent.py

   Loads dark current images and integrates according to calibration
parameters obtained from calibrate.py after performing median filtering.
