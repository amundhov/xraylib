=== INSTALLATION ===

Normally you will want to create a virtual environment for using xrdtoolkit, as
it has not been packaged for any distributions. From your directory of choice,
   :~$ virtualenv --site-site-packages venv
   :~$ source venv/bin/activate

The second line needs to be executed every time you want to use the xrdtoolkit
installation contained in the virtual environment.

Then, to install xrdtoolkit simply invoke
   (venv):~$ ./develop.sh

which will pickle the x-ray data tables and ask setup.py to link up the
xrdtoolkit module and its scripts in your site-packages or,

   (venv):~$ ./install.sh

to perform a normal installation (development changes won't be seen).

Of course it's also possible to generate a python egg for use with easy_install

   $~: python setup.py bdist_egg && easy_install dist/*.egg


=== Overview ===

scripts/

The scripts directory contains command line scripts making available
functionality for performing detector tilt calibration (xrdtoolkit-calibrate),
azimuthal integration of series of diffraction images (xrdtoolkit-integrate),
peak-fitting for assembling DSCT sinograms (xrdtoolkit-assemble) and automated
sinogram correction and reconstruction (xrdtoolkit-reconstruct).
